# mtg-emulator
For playing Magic: the Gathering remotely with friends. The JS code acts as the player's hand and provides deck management: drawing, scrying, finding, adding, and shuffling. Battlefield, graveyard, and other gameplay areas are conducted in Google Slides (or in Powerpoint while streaming).

## Instructions
1. Open mtg.html
2. Input decklist
3. Play

## Recommendations During Use
- 2400x1600px Google/Powerpoint slides allow appropriately-sized images. Cards in the UI are 244px.
- Turning on OS clipboard history creates a safety net for mistakes.

## Limitations
Resizing UI window or inspecting in the browser will cause cards to display less effectively.
