# mtg-emulator
For playing Magic: the Gathering remotely with friends. The JS code acts as the player's hand and provides deck management: drawing, scrying, finding, adding, and shuffling. Battlefield, graveyard, and other gameplay areas are conducted in Google Slides (or in Powerpoint while streaming).

## Instructions
1. Open mtg.html and input decklist
2. Open a shared Google Slides document for battlefield and graveyard management
3. Play

## Recommendations During Use
- 2400x1600px Google/Powerpoint slides allow appropriately-sized images. Cards in the UI are 244px wide.
- Turning on clipboard history, if available on one's device, creates a safety net for mistakes.
- Every action in MTG is possible here, but some actions will require some creativity.

## Solutions for Bugs
If an image fails to load (which happens rarely and inconsistently), the problem can be solved by clearing the browser's cache and/or cookies, then refreshing the page. This will prematurely end your game, however.

## Other Limitations
Resizing the UI window or inspecting in the browser will cause cards to display less effectively.
